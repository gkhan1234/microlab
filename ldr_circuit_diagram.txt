How It Works:
-----------
1. The LDR and fixed resistor form a voltage divider
2. As light intensity increases, LDR resistance decreases
3. This causes the voltage at the junction point to decrease
4. The ESP32 ADC reads this voltage and converts it to a digital value
5. The code converts this digital value to a light level percentage

Calculation:
-----------
Voltage at junction = 3.3V × (10kΩ / (LDR resistance + 10kΩ))

- In darkness: LDR resistance is high (e.g., 100kΩ)
  Junction voltage ≈ 3.3V × (10kΩ / 110kΩ) ≈ 0.3V

- In bright light: LDR resistance is low (e.g., 1kΩ)
  Junction voltage ≈ 3.3V × (10kΩ / 11kΩ) ≈ 3.0V

Component Selection:
------------------
- LDR: Any standard photoresistor/LDR
- Resistor: 10kΩ is recommended, but you can adjust based on your LDR's characteristics
  - Use a smaller resistor (e.g., 4.7kΩ) for better sensitivity in low light
  - Use a larger resistor (e.g., 22kΩ) for better sensitivity in bright light

Calibration:
-----------
The code uses these values for calibration:
```
LDR_MIN = 0      # Minimum ADC value (darkest)
LDR_MAX = 4095   # Maximum ADC value (brightest)
```

You may need to adjust these values based on your specific environment and LDR characteristics:

1. To calibrate:
   - Cover the LDR completely (darkness) and note the ADC reading
   - Expose the LDR to the brightest light in your environment and note the reading
   - Update the LDR_MIN and LDR_MAX values in config.py accordingly

Tips:
----
- Keep wires as short as possible to reduce noise
- Consider adding a small capacitor (0.1μF) between the junction and ground to filter noise
- For outdoor use, ensure the LDR is protected from moisture
- The ESP32's ADC is non-linear; for precise measurements, consider implementing a calibration curve
