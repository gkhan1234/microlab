How It Works:
-----------
1. The soil moisture sensor has two probes that act as a variable resistor
2. When soil is dry, resistance between probes is high
3. When soil is wet, resistance between probes is low
4. The sensor module converts this resistance to a voltage
5. The ESP32 ADC reads this voltage and converts it to a digital value
6. The code converts this digital value to a moisture percentage

Typical Sensor Module:
--------------------
Most soil moisture sensors have a module with:
- Power indicator LED
- Comparator circuit (for digital output, not used in this project)
- Analog output (AO) that provides a voltage proportional to soil moisture

Reading Interpretation:
---------------------
The code uses these values for calibration:
```
SOIL_MIN = 0      # Minimum ADC value (driest)
SOIL_MAX = 4095   # Maximum ADC value (wettest)
```

For most soil moisture sensors:
- Higher ADC reading = Drier soil
- Lower ADC reading = Wetter soil

However, our code inverts this to provide a more intuitive percentage:
```python
moisture_percent = 100 - ((raw_value - config.SOIL_MIN) * 100) / (config.SOIL_MAX - config.SOIL_MIN)
```

So in our system:
- 0% = Completely dry
- 100% = Completely wet

Calibration:
-----------
To calibrate your sensor:
1. Place the sensor in completely dry soil (or air) and note the ADC reading
2. Place the sensor in water and note the ADC reading
3. Update the SOIL_MIN and SOIL_MAX values in config.py accordingly

Important Notes:
--------------
1. Power Considerations:
   - Most soil moisture sensors work best with 3.3V-5V
   - The ESP32 can provide 3.3V which is sufficient
   - For long-term use, consider powering the sensor only when taking readings to:
     * Extend sensor life (reduce corrosion)
     * Save power
     * Reduce electrolysis effects

2. Sensor Placement:
   - Insert probes to appropriate depth for the plant's root system
   - Ensure good contact with soil
   - Avoid placing near metal objects or pipes

3. Maintenance:
   - Clean probes periodically to remove mineral buildup
   - Some corrosion is normal over time
   - Consider coating probes with a corrosion-resistant material for long-term use

4. Accuracy:
   - Soil moisture sensors provide relative readings, not absolute moisture content
   - Readings can be affected by soil type, temperature, and mineral content
   - For scientific applications, consider calibrating for your specific soil type
